# Database Setup Guide

## Quick Fix for Development

Since the application is running but has database connection issues, you can:

1. **Use SQLite for development** (easiest):
   Update `prisma/schema.prisma`:
   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "sqlite"
     url      = "file:./dev.db"
   }
   ```

2. **Or set up PostgreSQL locally**:
   - Install PostgreSQL
   - Create database: `createdb dreamboard`
   - Update `.env.local` with your connection string

3. **For now, the app works with mock data** - all pages are functional!

## Current Status
✅ Application running on http://localhost:3000
✅ All pages working with mock data
✅ Color palette fixed for better visibility
✅ UI components properly styled

## Next Steps
1. Choose database option above
2. Run `npx prisma db push` to create tables
3. Run `npm run seed` to add sample data
4. Enjoy your DreamBoard application!
